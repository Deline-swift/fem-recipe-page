## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS for styling
- CSS custom properties
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

 I learnt how ro make use of the css custom properties which makes it possible to for me to easily reuse certain properties in my design.In the code snippet,i created custom properties for different colors of the design, and also created custom properties for font sizes in my design.
 also i learnt how to style markers which i used in my design.


```css

:root{
   --wt-1:700;
   --wt-2:600;
   --wt-3:400;
    --fs-1:30px;
    --fs-2:28px;
    --fs-3:19px;
    --defaultFontSize:16px;
    --white:hsl(0, 0%, 100%);
    --stone100:hsl(30, 54%, 90%);
    --stone150:Stone 150: hsl(30, 18%, 87%);
    --stone600:hsl(30, 10%, 34%);
    --stone900:hsl(24, 5%, 18%);
    --brown800:hsl(14, 45%, 36%);
    --rose50:hsl(330, 100%, 98%);
    --rose800:hsl(332, 51%, 32%);
    --sm:375px;
    --lg:1440px
    
}
```
I also learnt how to make use of semantic html tags in my html structure.as seen below with the main and the sectiontags

```html

<main>
  <section></section>
</main>
    

```
I still have to learn more about the use of media querries in html
i also need to learn more about importing fonts

### Useful resources

- [w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com) - This website assisted in implementing font import using the @font-face css asset
